 Hey, I’m Davis Peter – Welcome to My World
<br>
<br>
Art has always been my way of breathing. Before I ever thought about galleries or exhibitions, I was just a kid sketching in the margins of notebooks, trying to make sense of everything I felt but couldn’t put into words.
<br>
<br>
I grew up in a small town where creativity wasn’t exactly center stage, but it became my quiet escape. While other kids played ball or chased big-city dreams, I was chasing light and shadow with pencils and paint. My parents always encouraged me—never pushing, just gently reminding me that if something makes your heart beat faster, it’s probably worth following.
<br>
<br>
By high school, art became more than a hobby. It was a lifeline. I experimented constantly—digital art, charcoal, ink, acrylic, whatever I could get my hands on. I didn’t know if I’d make a career out of it, but I knew I had to keep creating.
<br>
<br>
Now I’m a freshman at SVU College, and everything’s starting to shift. I’ve been lucky to have my work gain some attention recently, which is wild and humbling. That’s part of why I made this site—to have a space that reflects who I am, where I’ve been, and where I’m headed.
<br>
<br>
This gallery isn’t just a portfolio—it’s a living timeline of my journey. Thanks for being a part of it.
<br>
<br>

 My Journey: A Timeline
2006 – Born in Oakridge, a small town with big skies
Where it all began—coloring on walls, sketching superheroes, and making messes that somehow told stories.
<br>
<br>
2012 – First sketchbook, first obsession
Age 6: Got my first real sketchbook from my mom. Filled it cover to cover with characters, dreamscapes, and monsters.
<br>
<br>
2015 – Local art contest, 1st place
Age 9: Entered a local fair art contest on a whim—and won. That ribbon still hangs in my room.
<br>
<br>
2018 – Middle school: discovered digital art
Found an old tablet, downloaded a free drawing app, and never looked back. Digital opened up a whole new world.
<br>
<br>
2020 – High school years: full immersion
Started sharing my work online, joined the art club, and spent late nights refining my style. Art went from passion to identity.
<br>
<br>
2023 – Graduated high school, committed to SVU College
With a sketchbook in one hand and a dream in the other, I took the next step in my creative journey.
<br>
<br>
2024 – Freshman year begins, the gallery opens
My work started gaining attention, and I launched this site as a space to grow, share, and connect.
